	<h1>Last night in Matera</h1>
	<div class="page-content"><p>Five people in a cave with electricity. Seven cushions made in the local furniture factory. 14 candles in the porous holes of stone walls.</p>
<p>They all go dark at the same time, a wick length of 1.5 hours. A few of them smoke out the wall, black ash trailing upward.</p>
<p>There is a grumble from the oldest in the circle – he is 40, Irish and Indian, well-spoken, dominating, and enlightened. “Sometimes it&#39;s about love.</p>
<p>“And I don&#39;t use that word often.</p>
<p>“Everyone is shiny, happy.” There is a feeling there.</p>
<p>He talks about starting communities. Rather than looking to government funding and development policy to start spaces in derelict municipal buildings, we could look to certain people, using the free market to keep privately leased infrastructure running.</p>
<p>He points around the room, “Serious programmer. Serious programmer, lazy but serious programmer, serious programmer.” He doesn&#39;t point to me.</p>
<p>“We have a group with some insanely talented people.”</p>
<p>A man, mid-30s with curly red hair, lays against a pillow, looking the most explicitly relaxed person in the room; it&#39;s a sign of slight trepidation, potential disengagement.</p>
<p>“I could go back to London, and in a few weeks have a job. You could take a few people with 5, 6 figure jobs, they could work for one year.</p>
<p>“Those people should only have to do that every 3—or 5—years. And they&#39;d need a lot of support from the people around them. I mean <em>a lot</em>—shit would get weird.”</p>
<p>A smallish, young woman—who talks in maniacally short bursts, with most of her dialogue pointed back at herself: her connections, her desires for Gaelic poetry—interrupts, “I think you&#39;re wrong. I think you could have a job in a few days.”</p>
<p>He shifts back slightly, sitting up straighter, “Yeah, but that&#39;s not me. That&#39;s London.”</p>
<p>We try to summon an ancient feeling; the heater cracks and the boxed wine in plastic cups leaves us slightly disoriented.</p>
